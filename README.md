#### Analysis of Unstructured High-Density Crowded Scenes for Video Surveillance and Crowd Monitoring

##### Computer vision algorithms can extract information from videos of crowded scenes and automatically track groups of individuals undergoing organized motion which might represent anomalous behavior. Computational tools and applied mathematics are indispensable for automated image analysis of human crowds, where information about changes in pixel intensity is translated into particle tracks used to detect rapid changes in crowd dynamics. I proposed to use the existing infrastructure of video cameras for collecting images and develop an innovative software system for parsing of significant events by analyzing image sequences taken inside and outside of sports stadia. 

##### My specific aims would be: 1. Design and implement software for automated human detection and use our existing image analysis algorithms for human tracking in crowded scenes. 2. Develop novel computer vision algorithms for classification of motion patterns and anomalous motion identification in video surveillance. 

##### My existing optimal-cost algorithm has been improved to handle sparse datasets by applying Markov Random Field. The feature selection is based on detectors such as SIFT, SURF, or ORB. To compute circular expectation maximization, the assignment uses a mixture of von Mises distributions. The weights of the Pareto optimality multi-objective function are based on Bayesian statistics, which makes the algorithm self-adaptive with rapid convergence within several iterations. An implementation with robotics computer vision libraries allows for real-time analysis on-the-fly. 

##### I aim at developing a system which can reliably analyze the behavior of up 200,000 people and vehicles located inside and in the surroundings of a large stadium. My goal is to create a fully automated accident aversion system, which detects anomalous behaviors in real time as events are progressing. 

##### Rationale: Video cameras monitoring the activity of people around sports venues are commonplace in cities worldwide. At sports games, where crowds of tens of thousands gather, such monitoring is important for safety and security purposes. It is also challenging to automate. Human operators are generally employed for the task, but even the most vigilant individuals may fail to see important information that could ultimately signal the onset of a potentially dangerous situation, such as the overcrowding of a sector of the stadium. 

##### My research efforts have been focused on the development of a system that provide the security personnel on-the-fly with automatedly generated alert signal regarding rapid motion of groups of individuals or events of interest in crowded scenes. More specifically, the system would offer crowd density estimation and prediction of overcrowding in front of the gates and parking lots around the sports arenas, as well as within the stadium. 

##### Additionally, my system would be able to detect, in real-time, when small groups of fans are about to confront each other and **predict the place of clash prior to the actual confrontation** by calculating the speed and direction of motion of the opposing groups. 

##### Significance: I apply computer vision methods to capture organized movement of groups of spectators in crowded scenes. Tracking in unstructured crowded scenes has gained momentum in computer vision for the surveillance of human or vehicle motion in vulnerable public areas such as stadia, airports, train stations or roads. My approach offers a high-speed solution allowing real-time tracking. Thus, it could be used to predict on-the-fly anomalous behaviors or congestions associated with a security alert outside or within a sports stadium, an airport terminal or with the arrival of a new train in a highly frequented station. 

##### This project would generate novel technology, which can be used to analyze live videos of conflict situations at different types of sports stadiums, e.g., for association football (soccer), American football, and baseball. Furthermore, I envisage additional applications such as using the technology to detect dangerous behaviors at airports, train station, political rallies, mass demonstrations, music festivals, large chain stores, busy resorts, among a number of other important security applications. 

##### I would develop software applications for various platforms and devices, such as CCTV camera systems, smartphones (iOS/Android) as well as smart glasses (Vive/HoloLens). My technology can be made available as a software as a service (SaaS) through a web interface, where additional algorithmic modules for the analysis of live images with specific types of motion from live cameras or other imaging methods can be continuously added.
