-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Goldberg_C.shell file contains two programs, written in C, 
for finding MAXIMUM-FLOW in UNDIRECTED graphs.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

These programs were written by Ed Rothberg to implement Goldberg's
``new max-flow algorithm'' (STOC 86). There are two main programs, for two  
types of input formats. 

MAIN PROGRAMS:
        - flow
        - matflow

REQUIRED FILES:
        README input.form output.form makefile main.c flow.c
        glib.c matfl.c graphtypes.h matrix.h matmain.c test.mat test.in

TO GET THESE FILES:
        Run the "goldberg_c.shell" file in the /bin/sh shell. 
		(It will unwrap itself.)
		Or copy the files themselves.

FILE DESCRIPTIONS: 
        input.form:  Describes the input formats for flow and matflow. 
        output.form: Describes output formats for flow and matflow
					Note: The DIMACS standard for maxflow needs a 
							directed graph so it cannot be converted 
							into this format.

        test.in:  A sample input for flow
        test.mat: A sample input for mat

        The others are source code files written in C language.

HOW TO MAKE THE PROBLEM-SOLVERS:

		flow:  Solves max-flow for undirected graphs presented in an 
				adjacency-list format. 
  
       			Requires: flow.c, main.c, glib.c, graphtypes.h, makefile. 

       			To invoke: 		$make flow
                  				$flow filename.in

      	If no filename is given, flow uses standard input. It always  
      	writes to standard out.  

		matflow: Solves max-flow for complete undirected graphs presented in a
       			distance-matrix format.  

		       	Requires: 		matfl.c, flow.c, matmain.c, glib.c
								graphtypes.h, matrix.h, makefile.  

       			To invoke: 		$make matflow
        				        $matflow filename.in

		If no filename is given, matflow uses standard input. It 
       	always writes to standard out.
