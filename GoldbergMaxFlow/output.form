There will soon be available a program for translating from this output
format to the DIMACS standard format.  Contributions are welcome.  CCM

OUTPUT FORMAT FOR FLOW AND MATFLOW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First line: gives the total flow found 

Other lines:  One line for each node, giving the nonzero flow along 
   adjacent edges.  For each adjacent edge, there are two values: 
   the adjacent node index, and the flow along that edge. 

   For example:

   2: 4 5  5 1

   Means that from node 2 there is and edge to node 4 with flow 5 and 
      and edge to node 5 with flow 1.
