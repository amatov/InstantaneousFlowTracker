Disclaimer: the following description was obtained  by inspection of the
code and some simple tests.  It was not written by the implementor.  CCM

There will soon be available a program for translating from the DIMACS
standard format to this format.  Contributions are welcome. CCM

INPUT FORMAT FOR FLOW:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Graph I/O is performed by a generic graph library package, 
   so some of the fields are ignored by the max-flow code (but 
   you must include dummy fields in the input). 

   The first vertex listed in the file is assumed to be the source;  
   the last vertex is assumed to be the sink. 

   There are three types of lines: the first line, vertex lines, 
   and edge lines. The fields in each line type are as follows. 

   First line-> size edges U
      size: integer giving number of vertices
      edges: integer giving number of edges (ignored)
      U: character ``U'' or ``u'' specifying an undirected graph

   Vertex lines->  degree vlabel xcoord ycoord
      degree: edge degree of the vertex
      vlabel: vertex label (ignored--vertices are referred to by index)
      xcoord: integer x-coordinate location (ignored)
      ycoord: integer y-coordinate location (ignored) 

      *****Each vertex line is followed immediately by the lines 
      for all its adjacent edges (thus each edge appears twice, 
      once for each vertex).******

   Edge lines-> adjacent  capacity
      adjacent: index (not vlabel) of the adjacent vertex
      capacity: integer edge capacity 
     
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT FORMAT FOR MATFLOW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Input files for matflow present a complete undirected graph
   as the upper-triangular part of an integer distance matrix. 

   First line -> size M
     size: integer giving number of vertices
     M: character ``M'' or ``m'' specifying matrix format
 
   Matrix lines: 
      Each entry is a positive integer giving edge capacity.  

      First line corresponds to vertex 1. Contains size-1 
      entries, for edges (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) . . . (1,size). Terminates
      with newline.

      Second line corresponds to vertex 2.  Contains entries for 
      (2,3)  (2,4) ... (2,size). Terminates with newline. 

      And so forth.  Here is an example of a 4-node graph.
